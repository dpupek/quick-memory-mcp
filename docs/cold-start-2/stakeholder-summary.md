# Stakeholder Summary – ColdStart MCP Tool

## Agents

- Gain a single, structured tool for getting oriented on a project:
  - Curated cold-start recipes.
  - The latest activity, optionally focused on a specific epic.
- Spend less time wiring together multiple MCP calls and more time
  acting on the information.

## Admins / Operators

- Can define and refine cold-start recipes as normal entries:
  - Tag them with `category:cold-start`.
  - Mark them curated/canonical as they are refined.
- No new storage or config; everything rides on existing stores.

## Developers / Teams

- New team members and support engineers can quickly understand what
  has been happening in a project and how to get started.
- Encourages documenting good “start here” flows and keeping them up to
  date.
