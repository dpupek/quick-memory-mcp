## Stakeholder summary

- **Admins/Ops**: can set backup targets (including network shares), adjust schedules/retention, run ad-hoc backups, and confirm success/failure from one blade.
- **Developers**: clearer visibility into backup health and recent runs reduces support time; activity feed aids debugging after deploys.
- **Security/compliance**: ensures backups land on approved storage with proof of success/failure; health surfacing prevents silent backup gaps.
